## What is Functional Programming ?

There are 2 types of languages basicly. 

#### Imperative Languages
     - Based on how to solve a problem
     - Procedural
     - Object Oriented 
     
#### Functional Languages 
     - Declarative
     - Based on What to Solve
     - Functional
     - Logic
     
In programming we need to avoid from side effects. So in functional programming we will solve problems with using lambda calculus and avoid from side effects, passing and returning functions as parameters.

There are functional languages using object oriented features like F#, Ocaml, Scala. Also there are imperative languages using functional features like Python, Ruby, C#, Java.
